         Welcome to Tea Time, where we take steeping our tea as seriously as we take avoiding serious lawsuits. 
         By entering the whimsical wonderland of Tea Time, you agree to embark on a journey filled with the delightful 
         aroma of carefully brewed leaves and the occasional snarky comment from our resident tea leaves whisperer, Earl Greyt.

      <p>
         Terms and Conditions, or as we fondly call them, "Tea-rms and Condi-sips," are here to ensure that your experience 
         is as smooth as our Chamomile Infusion. In the unlikely event that you find yourself caught in a heated debate with 
         our feisty teapot mascot, Sir Steeps-a-Lot, over the proper way to pronounce "scone" (it's 'scon,' obviously), please 
         refrain from throwing hot beverages in frustration. We take no responsibility for burnt taste buds, bruised egos, or any 
         existential crises that may arise from such debates.
      </p>
      <p>
         Remember, at Tea Time, we believe in the power of tea to bring people together, unless you're trying to stir up trouble. 
         In that case, we'll kindly ask you to leaf the premises before things get steeply awkward. So, grab your cup, sip 
         responsibly, and let the tea-rrific times roll!
      </p>
