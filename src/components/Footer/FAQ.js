             for the sheer joy of tea enthusiasts. While not a secret society, we invite you to explore the enchanting world

            Can I invoke the warranty if my teapot refuses to brew anything other than disco-themed teas?

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
             Ah, the rebellious teapot phase! While we celebrate its zest for life, our warranty specifically covers defects 
             in materials and workmanship. If your teapot's taste in music exceeds its brewing capabilities, unfortunately, we can't 
             guarantee a replacement. However, our Tea-surance Wizards are always up for a chat and might have some playlist 
             recommendations to soothe both you and your teapot's wild side.
