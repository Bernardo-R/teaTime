            At Tea Time, we understand that sometimes life throws unexpected tea leaves your way, and the blend you 
            thought would be your soulmate turns out to be more like a distant cousin. Fret not, for our return policy, 
            affectionately dubbed the "Sip & Ship Guarantee," is here to ensure your tea journey remains delightful and drama-free.

            If, for any reason, you find yourself dissatisfied with your tea-related purchase, you have our blessing to initiate 
            a return within 30 days. Simply send back the unused items, and we'll process your refund faster than a tea bag takes 
            a plunge in hot water. Please note that we can't accept returns on personalized tea leaves or any items that have suffered 
            accidental tea-related incidents, like an unfortunate matcha spill during an impromptu kitchen dance-off.

            For returns, think of us as your tea-flavored therapy. Reach out to our Tea Time Troubleshooters, and they'll guide you 
            through the return process with the grace of a well-poured chamomile infusion. We're committed to making your return experience 
            smoother than a perfectly brewed cup of Darjeeling.

            Remember, tea is a journey, and we want yours to be steeped in satisfaction. So, if you're not over the moon with your 
            Tea Time purchase, return it to us, and let's find the perfect blend for your sipping pleasure. After all, life's too 
            short to settle for a tea that doesn't make your taste buds do a happy dance!
